# SpringBootExample

SPRING BOOT IS ABOUT MAKING IT EASIER TO CREATE STAND-ALONE, PRODUCTION-GRADE SPRING BASED APPLICATIONS WITH LESS CONFIGURATIONS, WHICH INCLUDES AN EMBEDDED TOMCAT OR JETTY SERVER. BEHIND THE SCENES, IT USES SPRING FRAMEWORK (SPRING CORE, SPRING MVC ETC.)

- Get started by creating a spring boot app using Spring Initalizer :
        http://start.spring.io

Note :
 * A collection of Maven dependencies are automatically added.
 * Maven wrapper files (mvnw) - allows to run maven project and doesn't require maven to be pre-installed
 * Place your main application class in ROOT package above your other packages
 * DO NOT USE src/main/webapp DIRECTORY IF YOUR APPLICATION IS PACKAGED AS JAR
 
 - SPRING-BOOT-DEVTOOLS automatically restarts your application when code is updated.
 
 - SPRING-BOOT-ACTUATOR exposes endpoints to monitor and manage your application where endpoints are prefixed with "/actuator"
 
 - SPRING SECURITY will prompt for login where the default username is user and you can check the console log for the password.    However, we can override them in application.properties.

- SPRING BOOT uses 1000+ properties which can be logically divided into following groups:
    # CORE
    # WEB
    # SECURITY
    # DATA
    # ACTUATOR
    # INTEGRATION
    # DEVTOOLS
    # TESTING
